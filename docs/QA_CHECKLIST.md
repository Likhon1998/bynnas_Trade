## 11. Happy-path full cycle (must pass)

2. [ ] Super Admin approves (stock reserves)  
3. [ ] Warehouse pick → pack → dispatch → deliver  
4. [ ] Invoice exists  
5. [ ] Record + verify payment  
6. [ ] Commission appears for salesman (if order attributed)  
7. [ ] Dashboard / Analytics reflect activity

- [ ] CSRF: form posts without token fail (browser normal forms include `@csrf`)
- [ ] Invalid partner/contact form data shows validation errors

---

## Quick smoke (10 minutes)

If short on time, only run:

1. Public home + partner apply  
2. Admin login + dashboard  
3. Approve one pending order → deliver → invoice → verify payment  
4. Field login + check-in  
5. Shop portal login + products  
6. One report CSV + notifications bell
